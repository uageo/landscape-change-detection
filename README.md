 
# Landscape Change Detection Using Remote Sensing Data

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting and analyzing landscape changes using remote sensing technologies. By leveraging high-resolution satellite imagery and aerial data, we aim to identify and quantify changes in land use, vegetation cover, and other critical landscape features over time.

## Objectives
- **Develop Algorithms**: Create algorithms for processing and analyzing remote sensing data to detect landscape changes.
- **Visualize Changes**: Generate visualizations that effectively communicate detected changes to stakeholders.
- **Inform Decisions**: Provide insights into environmental trends to support land management decisions.

## Features
- **Data Processing**: Automated workflows for processing satellite imagery and aerial data, including preprocessing steps such as atmospheric correction and image normalization.
- **Change Detection Algorithms**: Implementation of various techniques, both supervised and unsupervised, to identify significant alterations in landscape features.
- **Visualization Tools**: Interactive maps and charts that illustrate changes over time, allowing users to explore the data intuitively.
- **Reporting**: Generation of comprehensive reports summarizing findings, methodologies, and implications for land use planning.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: JavaScript and Python for data analysis and algorithm development.
- **Libraries**: 
  - Image Processing: OpenCV, scikit-image, rasterio
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Folium
- **Data Sources**: Satellite imagery from Sentinel-2 and Landsat, along with aerial imagery from drones.
