# landscape-change-detection
This project focuses on the detection and analysis of landscape changes using data from remote sensing technologies. By leveraging high-resolution satellite imagery and aerial data, we aim to identify and quantify changes in land use, vegetation cover, and other critical landscape features over time.
Objectives
To develop algorithms for processing and analyzing remote sensing data to detect changes in landscapes.
To create visualizations that effectively communicate the detected changes to stakeholders.
To provide insights into environmental trends and inform land management decisions.
Features
Data Processing: Automated workflows for processing satellite imagery and aerial data, including preprocessing steps such as atmospheric correction and image normalization.
Change Detection Algorithms: Implementation of various change detection techniques, including supervised and unsupervised methods, to identify significant alterations in landscape features.
Visualization Tools: Interactive maps and charts that illustrate changes over time, allowing users to explore the data intuitively.
Reporting: Generation of comprehensive reports summarizing findings, methodologies, and implications for land use planning.
Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python for data analysis and algorithm development.
Libraries: OpenCV, scikit-image, and rasterio for image processing; Matplotlib and Folium for visualization.
Data Sources: Satellite imagery from sources such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat, along with aerial imagery from drones.
